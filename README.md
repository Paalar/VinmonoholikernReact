# VinmonoholikernReact
A React version of Vinmonoholikern (Django project is AlcoSearch)

Vinmonoholikern uses Vinmonopolets CSV database and sorts through the items by what is cheapest with the factors literprice and ABV.

This doesn't include the backend server or the sql database.


## Functionality to be added
- Include advanced search so you can filter on different types of alcohol
- Add the Swedish 'Systembolaget' so you can see what is cheaper where
- If possible connect the products sold with the location of the stores.
- CSS that fits mobile users. Removed bootstrap since it seems too inconsistent with React (different updates supporting different versions)
